Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the sale prices of houses using various features related to property characteristics, location, and market conditions. The project addresses the following questions:

What are the key factors affecting house prices?
How accurately can we predict house prices based on the available data?
Objectives
Develop models to predict house prices using a variety of regression techniques.
Identify and analyze the features that significantly impact housing prices.
Improve prediction accuracy through feature selection and engineering.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

House Characteristics: Information about the physical attributes of the houses (e.g., size, type, year built).
Location Details: Data related to the location and neighborhood of the houses.
Market Data: Historical sales prices and other relevant market indicators.
Key Features Include:
MSSubClass: Type of dwelling involved in the sale.
MSZoning: General zoning classification.
LotArea: Lot size in square feet.
OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality of the house.
YearBuilt: Original construction date.
SalePrice: The target variable representing the sale price of the property.
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Missing values were addressed using median imputation, mode imputation, or by removing columns with high missing ratios (e.g., Alley, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature).
Feature Scaling: Applied standard scaling to numerical features to normalize data ranges.
Encoding Categorical Features: Used label encoding for categorical variables.
Transformation for Skewness: Applied log transformation on skewed numerical features and on SalePrice to reduce skewness.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Investigated relationships between key features and the target variable.
Visualized distributions of various features and identified potential outliers.
Analyzed correlations to determine which features are most predictive of housing prices.
Key correlations identified include:
OverallQual and SalePrice: 0.79
GrLivArea and SalePrice: 0.71
GarageCars and SalePrice: 0.64
Feature Engineering
Created new features by combining existing attributes (e.g., TotalSF combining TotalBsmtSF, 1stFlrSF, and 2ndFlrSF).
Performed feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and importance scores from tree-based models.
Created composite features such as Total_Bathrooms and YrBltAndRemod.
Model Development
Baseline Models
Linear Regression: Used as a baseline with performance metrics to compare against more complex models.
Advanced Models
Implemented and Compared Performance of Multiple Models Including:
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
ElasticNet
PCA Analysis: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on both scaled and unscaled data to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Conducted hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Cross-Validation, particularly for Gradient Boosting Regressor, which yielded the best results.
Best Model
Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameters:
learning_rate: 0.01
n_estimators: 1000
max_depth: 3
min_samples_split: 10
Achieved the lowest mean squared error on validation data.
Results
The best-performing model was the Gradient Boosting Regressor with tuned hyperparameters, achieving the lowest mean squared error.
Key features identified as most important included overall quality, total square footage, and year built.
Implemented model selection and dimensionality reduction to enhance prediction accuracy.
Future Improvements
Explore the use of deep learning models such as neural networks to capture complex patterns in data.
Incorporate additional data sources like economic indicators or more granular location data for improved predictions.
Experiment with more advanced feature engineering techniques, including interactions between features.
Business Value
Improved Investment Decisions: Accurate price predictions help investors make better decisions regarding property purchases and sales.
Market Insights: Insights into key drivers of house prices can guide developers and policymakers in their strategic planning.
Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: Real estate agencies can provide more reliable advice to clients, enhancing trust and service quality.
